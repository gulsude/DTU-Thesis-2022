# Application of deep neural networks architectures, attention mechanisms and embeddings for improved prediction of receptor-ligand interactions

This thesis has been prepared over five months from 31st of January 2022 to 24th of June 2022, at the Immunoinformatics and Machine Learning Group, Department of Bioinformatics, Technical University of Denmark (DTU), and supervised by Professor Morten Nielsen. The project counts for 30 ECTS points and is submitted in partial fulfilment for the degree Master of Science in Engineering.

The folder data has the peptide-MHC class I data in five data partitions. 
The folder source has the matrices used in the project.
Inside pipeline/procedure includes the prediction models used in this project, as well as the analysis done on the results.
Inside the pipeline/original/scripts, you will find the Jupyter notebooks that includes the training process of models.
